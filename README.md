- **IS_TEAM_DRIVE** : Set to "true" if GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID is from a Team Drive else set to "false" or leave it empty.
- **USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS** : Whether to use service accounts or not. For this to work see  "Using service accounts" section below.

        > shortzon.com
        
        Additionally, some other shorteners are also supported.

**NOTE:**
- You can limit the maximum concurrent downloads by changing the value of 'MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS' in 'aria.sh'. By default, it's set to '3'.
- You can limit the maximum download speed by changing the value of 'MAX_DOWNLOAD_SPEED' in 'aria.sh'. By default, it's set to '0' (unlimited).

## Getting Google OAuth API Credential File

- Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
- Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
- Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID.
- Choose Other and Create.
- Use the download button to download your credentials.
- Move that file to the root of mirror-bot, and rename it to 'credentials.json'.
- Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library).
- Search for Drive and enable it if it is disabled.
- Finally, run the script to generate the token file (token.pickle) for Google Drive:
```
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```

## Dynamic Config (optional)

### Prerequisites

- 'config files' refers to these 3 files:

      config.env
      credentials.json
      token.pickle
- These config files can be generated by following the two above mentioned sections.
- Create a new folder in your Google Drive, irrespective of the folder you use for uploading files with this bot (no constraints).
- Change the permissions of this newly created folder to 'Anyone on the Internet with this link can view'.
- Upload the config files to this newly created folder.
- Copy the FileIDs of these config files.
- Setup the 'dynamic_config.env' file:
```
cp dynamic_config_sample.env dynamic_config.env
nano dynamic_config.env
```

### Reference

- **CONFIG_ENV** : Google Drive FileID for 'config.env' file.
- **CREDENTIALS_JSON** : Google Drive FileID for 'credentials.json' file.
- **TOKEN_PICKLE** : Google Drive FileID for 'token.pickle' file.
- **DL_WAIT_TIME** : Time to wait for aria2 to download the config files. By default it's set to '5' seconds, which is more than enough for deploying the bot to Heroku.

**NOTE:** If 'DL_WAIT_TIME' lapses, and the config files are not downloaded completely, the bot exits with exit code (1).

# Deploy to Heroku:

## Creating a Heroku App

- Create a [free Heroku Account](https://id.heroku.com/signup/login).
- Install Heroku CLI:
```
sudo snap install --classic heroku
```
- Login into your Heroku Account:
```
heroku login
```
- Visit [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com) and create a new app with any name (for our reference, your-mirror-bot) and with any region you prefer, for your app to be served from.
- In the Deploy tab of your app dashboard, select  'Heroku Git' in Deployment Method.
- Change the Stack for the App using Heroku CLI:
```
heroku stack:set container --app your-mirror-bot
```
- Initialise the project files as a Git Repository, push the Repo to 'Heroku Git' and build the Docker Image:
```
cd ~/Downloads/deploy_heroku
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
heroku git:remote --app your-mirror-bot
git push heroku master
```
- If the Docker Image Build succeeds, then, your push to the remote repository will succeed, otherwise, your push to the remote repository is rejected as the Docker Image Build fails.

## Run/Terminate the App

You can run/terminate the app by allocating/deallocating dynos to the app.

### Using Dashboard

- In the app dashboard, under resources tab, use the 'Edit Dyno Formation' button in Dynos section to change the working state of the app.

### Using CLI

- To Run:
```
heroku ps:scale worker=1 --app your-mirror-bot
```
- To Terminate:
```
heroku ps:scale worker=0 --app your-mirror-bot
```
- To Check Status:
```
heroku ps --app your-mirror-bot
```
- To Tail App Logs:
```
heroku logs --tail --app your-mirror-bot
```
