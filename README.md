- **USER_SESSION_STRING** : Session string generated by running:
```
python3 generate_string_session.py
```
- **TELEGRAPH_TOKEN** : Telegraph Token generated by running:
```
python3 generate_telegraph_token.py

### Optional Fields (Leave empty if unsure)

- **IS_TEAM_DRIVE** : Set to "true" if GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID is from a Team Drive else set to "false" or leave it empty.
- **USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS** : Whether to use service accounts or not. For this to work see  "Using service accounts" section below.
- **STOP_DUPLICATE_MIRROR** : Set this to "true", if you want to check for duplicate files (using file name, and not file hash) in Google Drive matching the requested download and stop the download if found any.
- **INDEX_URL** : Refer to [GDIndex repo](https://github.com/maple3142/GDIndex/). The URL should not have any trailing '/'.
- **SHORTENER** : URL of the Shortener.

        > shrinkme.io
        > urlshortx.com
        > shortzon.com
        
        Additionally, some other shorteners are also supported.

**NOTE:**
- You can limit the maximum concurrent downloads by changing the value of 'MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS' in 'aria.sh'. By default, it's set to '3'.
- You can limit the maximum download speed by changing the value of 'MAX_DOWNLOAD_SPEED' in 'aria.sh'. By default, it's set to '0' (unlimited).

## Getting Google OAuth API Credential File

- Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
- Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
- Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID.
- Choose Other and Create.
- Use the download button to download your credentials.
- Move that file to the root of mirror-bot, and rename it to 'credentials.json'.
- Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library).
- Search for Drive and enable it if it is disabled.
- Finally, run the script to generate the token file (token.pickle) for Google Drive:
```
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```

## Dynamic Config (optional)

### Prerequisites

- 'config files' refers to these 3 files:

      config.env
      credentials.json
      token.pickle
- These config files can be generated by following the two above mentioned sections.
- Create a new folder in your Google Drive, irrespective of the folder you use for uploading files with this bot (no constraints).
- Change the permissions of this newly created folder to 'Anyone on the Internet with this link can view'.
- Upload the config files to this newly created folder.
- Copy the FileIDs of these config files.
- Setup the 'dynamic_config.env' file:
```
cp dynamic_config_sample.env dynamic_config.env
nano dynamic_config.env
```

### Reference

- **CONFIG_ENV** : Google Drive FileID for 'config.env' file.
- **CREDENTIALS_JSON** : Google Drive FileID for 'credentials.json' file.
- **TOKEN_PICKLE** : Google Drive FileID for 'token.pickle' file.
- **DL_WAIT_TIME** : Time to wait for aria2 to download the config files. By default it's set to '10' seconds, which is more than enough for deploying the bot to Heroku.

**NOTE:** If 'DL_WAIT_TIME' lapses, and the config files are not downloaded completely, the bot exits with exit code (1).

# Deploy to Heroku:

## Creating a Heroku App

- Create a [free Heroku Account](https://id.heroku.com/signup/login).
- Install Heroku CLI:
```
sudo snap install --classic heroku
```
- Login into your Heroku Account:
```
heroku login
```
- Visit [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com) and create a new app with any name (for our reference, your-mirror-bot) and with any region you prefer, for your app to be served from.
- In the Deploy tab of your app dashboard, select  'Heroku Git' in Deployment Method.
- Change the Stack for the App using Heroku CLI:
```
heroku stack:set container --app your-mirror-bot
```
- Initialise the project files as a Git Repository, push the Repo to 'Heroku Git' and build the Docker Image:
```
cd ~/Downloads/deploy_heroku
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
heroku git:remote --app your-mirror-bot
git push heroku master
```
- If the Docker Image Build succeeds, then, your push to the remote repository will succeed, otherwise, your push to the remote repository is rejected as the Docker Image Build fails.

## Run/Terminate the App

You can run/terminate the app by allocating/deallocating dynos to the app.

### Using Dashboard

- In the app dashboard, under resources tab, use the 'Edit Dyno Formation' button in Dynos section to change the working state of the app.

### Using CLI

- To Run:
```
heroku ps:scale worker=1 --app your-mirror-bot
```
- To Terminate:
```
heroku ps:scale worker=0 --app your-mirror-bot
```
- To Check Status:
```
heroku ps --app your-mirror-bot
```
- To Tail App Logs:
```
heroku logs --tail --app your-mirror-bot
```
